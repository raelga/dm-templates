  title: A template for creating a pool of similar instances in a zone.
  author: Google, Inc.
  description: |
    This template lets users create a collection of instances of a given type,
    number and zone. This can also be achieved using InstanceGroupManager, but
    this templates does it without using one.

    NOTE: Unlike InstanceGroupManager pools, this pool does not re-create
    instances upon failure or termination to keep up with the target pool
    size.

properties:

  description:
    type: string
    description: >
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

  region:
    type: string
    default: europe-west1
    description: >
      The region where the instance resides.

  zone:
    type: string
    default: europe-west1-b
    description: >
      The zone where the instance resides.

  subnetwork:
    type: string
    default: compute-sn
    description: >
      The subnetwork where the network interface will be attached.

  bootDiskImage:
    type: string
    default: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
    description: >
      The source image to create the instance boot disk.

  bootDiskSizeGb:
    type: integer
    minimum: 10
    maximum: 100
    default: 10
    description: >
      Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.

  machineType:
    type: string
    default: f1-micro
    descripton: >
      Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this instance,
      in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type.

  reservedPublicAddress:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      Attach an ephemeral instance public IP address.

  ephemeralPublicAddress:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      Attach an ephemeral instance public IP address.

  deletionProtection:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: >
      Whether the resource should be protected against deletion.

  canIpForward:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      Allows this instance to send and receive packets with non-matching
      destination or source IPs. This is required if you plan to use this
      instance to forward routes. For more information:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-routes#canipforward

  preemptible:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      Defines whether the instance is preemptible.
      This can only be set during instance creation, it cannot be set or
      changed after the instance has been created.

  onHostMaintenance:
    enum:
      - MIGRATE
      - TERMINATE
    default: MIGRATE
    description: >
      Defines the maintenance behavior for this instance.
      For standard instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE.
      For preemptible instances, the only possible behavior is TERMINATE.

  automaticRestart:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: >
      Specifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it
      is terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user).
      You can only set the automatic restart option for standard instances.
      Preemptible instances cannot be automatically restarted.
